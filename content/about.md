Hi ,I am Arindam Pradhan 20, I live in a small town Bhubaneswar in India. I am an electrical 
engineer undergraduate at [CET,Bhubaneswar](http://cet.edu.in/).

I have a keen intrest on FOOS and Competitive Programming. I enjoy programming because it's fun, 
keeps me focused and calm. Have a look at my [github](https://github.com/arindampradhan), these are 
some of my *works*. Currenty I am self teaching, I follow mostly blogs, tutorials and github 
projects. I easily get motivated a lot and my dream is to be the best programmer, master a single 
language and write lots(tons) of code.

I am a foodie and love french fries, hell ya I love playing games and try to complete them in a day. 
So, I get addicted to lots of caffine and coke. </p>
