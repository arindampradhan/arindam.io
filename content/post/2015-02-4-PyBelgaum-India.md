For people who don't know, [PyBelgaum](http://pybelgaum.org/2015/) 2015 is a local Python conference happening in Belgaum. It is a 2-day conference, conducted by the Python community under [PSF](https://www.python.org/psf/).

I was a speaker and my talk was on  [**Python wrapping a Json API**](http://junction.pybelgaum.org/pybelgaum/proposals/python-wrapping-a-json-api/). - [**slides**](https://github.com/arindampradhan/wrapping-api-talk)

<!--excerpt-->

I traveled *1,600 Km for 3 days*. Most of my time went sleeping on trains and buses. It felt like crazy, but I was excited to give a talk on my project.

The **talk** was about [yaaHN](https://github.com/arindampradhan/yaaHN) which wraps a simple [HackerNews API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API). It was a beginner talk and I was explaining students about **REST APIs** and services i.e coursera and hackernews api, how they work. In the end I showed them a [app](https://github.com/arindampradhan/mockHN) could be easily written using such APIs. The crowd was cheerful and very supportive.

Looking back, things have changed. I started learning python a year ago, an electrical major, trying to self-teach python from all kinds of website and opensource projects. Reading code from other people has helped me a lot than reading any books.

Anyways, back to my schedule : 

The **workshops** I attended:

* [Learn Python - 101 Workshop](http://junction.pybelgaum.org/pybelgaum/proposals/learn-python-101-workshop/) - Kracekumar Ramaraju

* [Gotchas in Python - When Python gets slippery for you](http://junction.pybelgaum.org/pybelgaum/proposals/gotchas-in-python-when-python-gets-slippery-for-you/) - Anand B Pillai

* [Python for Generating Network Anomalies](http://junction.pybelgaum.org/pybelgaum/proposals/python-for-generating-network-anomalies/) - Srinivas Naik

and the **Talks** I attended:

* [Understanding Python's DataStructure: Dictionary](http://junction.pybelgaum.org/pybelgaum/proposals/understanding-pythons-datastructure-dictionary/) - Sayan Chowdhury

* [CTR estimation using machine learning algorithms in Python](http://junction.pybelgaum.org/pybelgaum/proposals/ctr-estimation-using-machine-learning-algorithms-in-python/) - Rohit singh


All in all the talks were great, food was great :D. Loved it, the experience was chilling and my favourite part was attending the workshop

> Gotchas in Python - When Python gets slippery for you. It was fun trolling python. 

>Usually people love trolling javascript for it's weirdness, but python too gets it wrong at some point :D. 


And among talks: 

> Understanding Python's DataStructure: Dictionary. It was indeed a depth talk on dictionary, how it's key clashes and how to use it for better performance. 

I had a chance to talk to Sayan (great dude who works at Hackerearth, a proud mozillian and a gsoc 13), met him on last year Pycon India. Back then he was explaining me how **opensource** works. Contributing to opensource projects is fun though. It's hilarious when two PRs clash. 

I actually had a situation where I had to update a PR (reset/revert the previous commit) and another PR got merged at the same time. Unfortunately, both the PRs had a file in common which raised a conflict and due to the force updates there was a diversion in my branch. And finally while fixing it my repo crashed :P. It took me 5hrs to fix it. Haha .. :D 

I will come up with new stories...stay tuned
